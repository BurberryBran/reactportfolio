    "aboutme":"I am currently living In Tallahassee, Florida working on future ideas for buisnesses I would like to help prosper. Helping others has always been a passion of mine and making sure the work is perfect. I have grossed over 40 thousand followers in about two months on the popular phone app TikTok for helping others learn about growing aquatic plants. Since I was 12 I knew I had always wanted to be a creator, my goal moving forward would be to create web developed sites for myself and others to help and grow local buisness and make those life long dreams come true.",
